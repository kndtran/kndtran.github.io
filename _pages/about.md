Hi, I am a Research Software Engineer at [IBM Research - Almaden](https://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/). I've worked on a variety of projects at IBM, most recently, conversational AI, software engineering for scientists, and evaluating research software for foundational primitives in Watson NLP.

Before joining the Almaden lab, I was a
- research scientist at IBM Research - Australia, working on machine learning and NLP applications for business problems; and
- data scientist at [AUSTRAC](https://www.austrac.gov.au/), working on applying text mining and NLP to fight financial crimes.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [The Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/) on [Detecting Vandalism on Wikipedia across multiple languages](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/14453).

My research interests include natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), machine learning (ML), and the evaluation of these systems.
