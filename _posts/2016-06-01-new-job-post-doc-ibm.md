title: New job: Post Doctoral Researcher at IBM Research Australia
---

After just over a year at my first job, I've moved back to research, but in
industry. The old job was a research role in the APS but there was a lot more
development work rather than research. Furthermore, they don't understand what
research means anymore. Hopefully IBM will be different and it should be, as it
is a research lab.
