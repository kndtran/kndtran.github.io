The year has gone by quickly... This website has been bugging my mind in the
last few months because of the networking events I've been to. I do wonder how
many people have come here to find a rather empty website, haha. Well, I do
hope that you found the left side navigation useful.

This website needs a rethink. I spend most of my time on my workplace's
internal github, so I forget about this place quite often.

I have some ideas, which will be done this weekend. It won't be nearly 6 months
again :)
