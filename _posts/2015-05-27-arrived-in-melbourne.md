title: Arrived in Melbourne with a new job, new apartment, in a new city
---

After 20 years of living in Canberra, I've moved to Melbourne for a new job
with the Australian Government. I've managed to find an APS job outside of
Canberra!

I've settled for a short-term (6 month lease) in a studio apartment right next
to the Queen Victoria Markets and 15 minutes walk from work. I shouldn't need a
car while living here.

Melbourne feels overwhelming so far. Time to make new friends and discover this
city.
