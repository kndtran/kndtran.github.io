title: (Another) New website layout
---

I've been networking a lot lately, and the old website layout just didn't feel
right for what I was trying to present of myself. Since I will be doing a lot
networking in the future, I put in a good chunk of time to get this new website
layout up. Hopefully this will be the last time for many years.

I like this template so far. Clean and simple. Although, it really needs a
merge of the vitae and sustain repositories.
