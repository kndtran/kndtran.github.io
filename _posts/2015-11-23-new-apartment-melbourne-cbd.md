title: New apartment in Melbourne CBD on the 58th floor!
---

After 5 months of living in a small apartment with a terrible neighbour, it's
time to move onto a better apartment. It's a one bedroom apartment with a
rather odd powder room; seems to be a waste of living space. Signed a one year
lease, so will be here for a while.

I'm also starting to work out my finances, how to be more comfortable in
spending my money, what I can afford, and what I need to save for.
