title: New apartment in Southbank, just outside of the CBD grid
---

My old apartment on the 58th floor started to feel a little too expensive and
no longer provided the same value it had. Luckily, I met a friend through
meetup.com that was also looking to move out. After some searching, we've found
a building that we liked and managed to secure a decent 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom
apartment (with a carspace). This apartment is a lot larger than the 2 bedroom,
1 bathroom ones, so it's definitely an upgrade in quality of living with less
rent and also NBN!

We've signed a one year lease. I'm already saving nearly $100 a week from the
old place. More space, more internet, more money leftover, split bills,
friendly housemate. Everything looking up for the start of this year.
